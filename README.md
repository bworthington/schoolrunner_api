# schoolrunner_api
The purpose of this project is to use SchoolRunner's API and do stuff with data that is not possible or practical through the app.  Source code is written in Java and SQLite.

Here's the general idea:

1. Connect to one or more of SR's API endpoints (students, assessments, courses, etc.).
2. Pasrse the JSON results and save the data to a SQLite database.
3. Use SQLite to query the database to get the specific information we want.

Possible applications:

*Identifying assessments that are missing objectives and the teachers who created them (by linking the assessments and staff tables) and automatically emailing those staff with the assessments that need to be fixed.

### Requirements
This code requires a few .jar files be installed first:

Two files related to actually connecting to the API are: **okhttp-2.5.0.jar** and **okio-1.6.0.jar**.  Find out more and download them from http://square.github.io/okhttp/

One file is for JSON parsing: **json-simple.1.1.1.jar**.  Find out more and download it from https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/

One file is for the SQLite database: **sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar**.  Find out more and download it from http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_java.htm

### How It's Organized
**schoolrunner/api_processing** is a Java package that contains the core building blocks of this project:

* **ConnectToSRAPI** is the class that handles the connection to a given API endpoint.
* **Login** is the class that reads in a username and password for basic authentication in the API connection.
* **CreateDatabase** is the class that creates a database.
* **CreateTable** is the class that creates a given table within the database.
* **AssessmentsAPI** is the class that connects to the Assessments endpoint (using ConnectToSRAPI).  It can use a default URL or receive a specified URL (for example, with more parameters) through an overloaded constructor.  It parses the JSON results and saves the data to the relevant table of the database.  The same idea holds true for other similar classes related to specific endpoints (StudentsAPI, StaffAPI, etc.).
* **DatabaseSetup** is the class that manages setting up an entire database.  It uses the CreateDatabase and CreateTable classes to setup a database with specific tables.  It provides public methods that can be invoked in other classes to set up a database with any combination of tables we want.  The methods that set up a given table, like Assessments, also call on the related EndpointAPI class, like AssessmentsAPI, to go ahead and connect to the API and populate the table with that data.  When the DatabaseSetup constructor is used, that calls on the Login class to get the username and password, which are passed into the EndpointAPI objects and then to the ConnectToSRAPI object.
